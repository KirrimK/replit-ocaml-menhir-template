# Ocaml-menhir-template

A simple template that allows programming with ocaml while using ocamllex and the menhir parser generator on replit.com.

If you want to add your own packages, try adding them by adding the opam package to the replit.nix file (setting up opam might be CPU intensive, I didn't test it to completion), or by adding the packages directly (some like menhir might already be in the NixOS packages, for examples in the ocamlPackages set, see replit.nix for an example).
